By Thursday afternoon, the area bore signs of uncertainty; some shutters were down while others remained open.

At the very start of the season, violent incidents are sending the wrong message about Nepal abroad,” said Dhama, who also runs a hotel. “Bookings are being cancelled in large numbers.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Punya Ram Lagesu, Council Secretary and a clothing store owner, echoed the concern. He noted that Thamel typically enjoys two peak seasons—April-May and September-October. “But the protests at the start of the season have already caused a 20–25 per cent drop in business within days,” he said, adding that the unrest risks tarnishing Nepal’s reputation internationally.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Still, he remained cautiously optimistic.
