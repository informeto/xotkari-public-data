  "content_text": "Kathmandu, September 12 The Nepal Army has lifted the daytime curfew in the Kathmandu Valley. Now, the curfew will only be in effect from 7 pm this evening until 6 am on September 13. Along with lifting the daytime curfew, the army has also relaxed the restriction order (prohibitory order). According to a notice issued by the Nepal Army, the prohibitory order will now only be enforced from 11 am to 5 pm today. The security restrictions are being gradually eased following violent incidents during recent “GenZ” protests. As curfew and restrictions are being loosened, daily life in the Kathmandu Valley is returning to normal. Compared to the previous day, there has been an increase in the number of vehicles on the roads this morning. The Nepal Army took over security command from 10 pm on September 9 (Bhadra 24) after protests by GenZ youth against social media bans and corruption turned violent on September 8 (Bhadra 23). Initially, the army imposed a nationwide curfew, but it is now limited to the Kathmandu Valley. In some districts outside the Valley, local district administration offices have enforced curfews and prohibitory orders as needed. To clarify in simple terms: the purpose of a prohibitory order is to prevent gatherings and crowds, while a curfew is a stricter measure that completely bans movement and travel.
