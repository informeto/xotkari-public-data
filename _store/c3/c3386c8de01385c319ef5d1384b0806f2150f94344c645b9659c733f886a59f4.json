The temple opens only once a year on this day.\nFrom early morning, devotees have queued up to offer prayers and worship at the temple, which is regarded as the presiding deity (\nIshta Devata\n) of the Newar community. Taleju, also revered as a manifestation of divine power or mother goddess, is also known by the name Tulja.\nThe goddess was brought to the Mulchok courtyard of Hanumandhoka Palace on the day of Phulpati and will be returned to the main temple on Vijayadashami. On the night of Maha Ashtami, Kalaratri Puja was performed in the Mulchok, during which 54 goats and 54 buffaloes were sacrificed. The ritual is carried out through Tantric methods with the belief that it grants strength for state governance.\nOn Maha Navami, special worship of Goddess Durga is held at the Dashain Ghar, Kot courtyard, and other shrines and Shakti Peeths with animal sacrifices of goats, ducks, chickens, and buffaloes, along with recitations of\nDurga Saptashati (Chandi)\n,\nShrimad Devi Bhagavat\n, and other hymns dedicated to the goddess.\nThe Taleju Bhawani Temple, which opens only once a year, remained closed in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2021, however, it was opened after the risk of transmission declined following widespread vaccination.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nNepal’s Gen Z movement captures French media and inspires protesters\nFinance Ministry launches digital approval system\nIntellectual Council urges Oli to hand over UML leadership via central committee\nMisleading news affects mental health, ways to cope\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nBlog\nClay and culture: The making of Durga idols\n21 hours ago\nFestival\nTaleju Temple welcomes devotees on Maha Nawami\n23 hours ago\nTravel\nManaslu climbing in autumn starts on encouraging note; Nima Chhiring sets new record\n24 hours ago\nFestival\nMaha Astami festival being observed today\n2 days ago\nFood & beverage\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\n2 days ago",
