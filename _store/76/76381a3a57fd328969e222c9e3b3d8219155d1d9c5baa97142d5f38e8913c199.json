Each year, on Ashwin Shukla Saptami under the Durga Paksha, the\nNavapatrika\n(nine sacred plants) is ritually brought into homes according to classical traditions.\nFrom the day of Ghatasthapana, devotees worship Goddess Durga following Vedic rituals. On this day, sugarcane, turmeric, banana plant, rice stalks, bel leaves, pomegranate, jayanti, ashoka flowers, and manavriksha are ceremonially placed in the Dashain Ghar or household shrine.\nKnown as\nNavapatrika\nor\nPhulpati\n, these nine plants symbolize the presence of nine forms of the Goddess, each worshipped with prayers for divine strength. As explained by religious scholar Prof Dr Ram Chandra Gautam: “Brahmani is invoked in the banana plant, Rakta Dantika in the pomegranate, Lakshmi in the rice stalks, Durga in turmeric, Chamunda in manavriksha, Kali in sugarcane, Shiva in bel leaves, Shokarahita in ashoka, and Kartiki in jayanti. These deities are attendants of the Nava Durga.”\nThe Nepal Panchang Committee has stated that no special auspicious time is required for bringing in Phulpati.\nTraditionally, Phulpati for Hanumandhoka Durbar’s Dashain Ghar in Kathmandu is brought from Gorkha. Six Magar representatives, along with temple priests, carry it to Jivanpur of Dhading, from where six Brahmins from Kathmandu take it onward to Jamal. From Jamal, high-ranking government officials, the Gorkha regiment, bands, cultural troupes, and traditional music groups accompany the Phulpati procession to Hanumandhoka. This year, the ritual is scheduled for the afternoon.\nA team from Kathmandu left for Jivanpur on Saturday to collect the Phulpati, according to Sandip Khanal, chief of the Hanumandhoka Palace Care Office. From Jivanpur, the procession will pass through Swayambhu, where the sacred\nMane\nflower will also be added to the Navapatrika before reaching Jamal, where it will be formally received and carried to Hanumandhoka.\nDashain festivities gain momentum from today\nWith Phulpati, the Dashain festival begins to gather full momentum. The social celebrations of Durga Puja, which began on Ghatasthapana with the planting of\njamara\n(barley sprouts), intensify from this day onward.\nAs government offices close for the holiday, people working in different professions begin returning to their hometowns to receive\ntika\nand blessings from elders, causing Kathmandu Valley to gradually empty out. The usually busy streets now see fewer vehicles.\nMeanwhile, in villages, traditional wooden swings (\nlinge ping\nand\nrote ping\n) are set up in public spaces, adding to the festive atmosphere, while kite flying continues as a popular Dashain pastime.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nmonsoon\nKumari\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nCovid-19 outbreak mars Phulpati celebrations in Kathmandu\n5 years ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nNepal’s Gen Z movement captures French media and inspires protesters\nFinance Ministry launches digital approval system\nIntellectual Council urges Oli to hand over UML leadership via central committee\nMisleading news affects mental health, ways to cope\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nSociety\nMonsoon triggers flood and landslide risks in several districts, DHM issues special alert\n4 hours ago\nFestival\nLiving Goddess Kumari to offer Dashain Tika to public today\n4 hours ago\nFestival\nNepalis celebrate Bijaya Dashami, auspicious Tika time set at 11:53 am\n4 hours ago\nBlog\nClay and culture: The making of Durga idols\n1 day ago\nFestival\nTaleju Temple welcomes devotees on Maha Nawami\n1 day ago",
