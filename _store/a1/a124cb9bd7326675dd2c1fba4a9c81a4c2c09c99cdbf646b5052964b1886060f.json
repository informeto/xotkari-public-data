Committee member and religious scholar Prof Dr Devmani Bhattarai clarified that since the eclipse is not visible from Nepal, there is no need to abstain from rituals, nor does it bring any negative effects.\nHe explained that scriptures state eclipses not visible in the Nepali sky do not need to be observed or followed by the public.\nThe solar eclipse on Ashwin Krishna Aunsi will be visible only from countries such as New Zealand, Australia, Fiji, Tonga, and Antarctica, it has been reported.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nNepal misses the 1st solar eclipse of 2023.
