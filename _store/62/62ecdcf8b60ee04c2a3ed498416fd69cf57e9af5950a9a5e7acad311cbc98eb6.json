President Ramchandra Paudel is scheduled to attend the main function of the day to be held at Army Pavilion, Tundikhel in Kathmandu at 8:30 am today.\nOn the occasion, newly-appointed Prime Minister of the Interim Government Sushila Karki is addressing the ceremony. In the recent adverse political circumstances, events such as procession and parade for the day will not feature in the celebrations. The Constitution of Nepal was proclaimed on 3rd Asoj 2072 (20 September 2015) through the epoch-making Constituent Assembly which was formed on the backing of the arduous struggle and sacrifices of the Nepali people.\n‘The Constitution of Nepal, 2072’ was promulgated following the second round election to the Constituent Assembly with relentless efforts and prolonged disputes. It may be noted that the then President Dr Ram Baran Yadav had announced the promulgation of the Nepal Constitution from the CA meeting hall at the New Baneswor-based International Conference Centre in the evening of 3rd Asoj 2072 BS.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\noath\nMinister\nRastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS)\nRSS is a government-run national news portal of Nepal.\nMore From the Author\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\n‘Constitution grants authority to transfer public service funds to federal treasury,’ says Finance Ministry\n8 months ago\nMyopic vision led to instability in Nepal’s constitution\n1 year ago\nDecentralisation dilemmas: Lessons from Nepal’s federal transition\n1 year ago\nUnveiling the role of judicial activism in strengthening democracy\n1 year ago\nTime for coordination between local and federal government for better education system\n2 years ago\nPresident Ramchandra Paudel appoints Nepal’s ambassador to Canada and Portugal\n2 years ago\nMost Read\nUAE tightens visit visa rules for Nepalis\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n4 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n12 hours ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n14 hours ago\nCulture\nGhatasthapana performed at Hanumandhoka, marking the start of Dashain festival (Photos)\n17 hours ago\nPolitics\nInjured Gen Z protesters stage sit-in at Singha Durbar gate (Photos)\n2 days ago\nFestival\nWhat are the chances of rain during Dashain this year?\n2 days ago",
