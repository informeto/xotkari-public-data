According to the Road Division Office, Bharatpur, it may take the whole day to clear the debris.\nDue to the massive landslide around 4:5o pm  on Tuesday, traffic movement in both directions has been completely halted.\nVehicle owners, drivers, and passengers have been advised to use alternative routes.\nChitwan SP Govinda Puri said the massive dry landslide at Tuinkhola in Ichchhakamana Rural Municipality-5 has increased the risk of the road collapsing.\nSpeaking to\nOnlinekhabar\n, SP Puri said, “A very large landslide has occurred at Tuinkhola. Since it is a dry landslide, the risk of the road sinking has increased. Therefore, there is no possibility of the road opening anytime soon.”\nFollowing the landslide, the Narayangadh–Muglin road section has been closed indefinitely.\nA long queue of vehicles can be seen on the road, stretching all the way to Kurintar.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nLandslide\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMuglin-Narayangadh road closed for 38 hours as landslide clearance continues\n3 days ago\nBeni-Jomsom and Beni-Darbang roads obstructed by landslide\n1 month ago\nLandslide blocks Araniko Highway again\n2 months ago\nDumre-Ambukhaireni road section blocked by landslide\n2 months ago\n11 national highways completely blocked\n2 months ago\nContinuous rain triggers landslide halting traffic on Araniko Highway\n2 months ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nNew Gen-Z party could emerge in support of Balen\nHamas releases farewell picture of 48 hostages including Nepali Bipin Joshi\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n7 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n7 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nDisaster\nLandslide clearance begins on Narayangadh- Muglin Road\n5 minutes ago\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n24 hours ago\nInterview\nEva Maria Belser: Even a small country can practice effective federalism\n1 day ago\nOpinion\nHow foreign companies can register a branch office in Nepal\n1 day ago\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n2 days ago",
