Authorities have announced a three-day restriction on vehicular movement into and out of the Kathmandu Valley due to safety concerns.\nGovernment agencies have urged everyone to remain safe at their current locations, while police have been patrolling and making public announcements in various areas. With heavy rainfall expected to continue for a few more days, people have been advised to avoid travel unless absolutely necessary.\nPreliminary reports indicate that road infrastructure has suffered the most damage from the downpour. Here is the current condition of major highways:\nNagdhunga–Muglin Road Section Closed\n: A landslide at Jabang Khola in Benighat Rorang Rural Municipality-10 has blocked both lanes.\nMuglin–Narayangadh Road Halted\n: Although no landslide has occurred, authorities have stopped vehicular movement due to high risk. Vehicles heading towards Muglin have been held at safe locations in Bharatpur and Narayangadh.\nMuglin–Pokhara Road Restricted for Long-Distance Vehicles\n: While no landslide has occurred between Muglin–Kotre and Kotre–Pokhara, long-distance vehicles have been barred from traveling due to potential risks. Vehicles are being stopped at Kotre, Belchautara, Tharpu, Damauli, Dumre, Aanbukhaireni, and Muglin.\nAanbukhaireni–Gorkha and Dumre–Lamjung Roads Open\n: Both road sections remain operational with no restrictions.\nBP Highway Closed During the Day\n: The BP Highway has been completely closed even during daytime. Earlier, from September 30 to October 5, it had been closed only from 5 pm to 5 am daily.\nPrithvi Highway Blocked\n: A landslide in Benighat Rorang Rural Municipality-10, Dhading, has completely obstructed the road.\nAraniko Highway Closed\n: Since September 30, road collapse at Charkilo (Bhotekoshi), Sindhupalchok, has blocked the highway. Although it partially reopened for small vehicles on October 3, it was completely closed again the following morning after further damage.\nPasang Lhamu Highway Closed\n: The Miteri Bridge connecting the Nepal–China border point at Rasuwa Gadhi has been out of service since July 8. Landslides and falling rocks at Ghattikhola, Baluwa Khani, and Tatopani have kept the road closed since Sept 30.\nKoshi Highway Closed\n: Flooding at Bhotkhola–Barunkhola since May 19 washed away a culvert pipe, leaving the road blocked.\nMakalu–Ekkuwa Road Section Closed\n: A landslide since August 31 has completely obstructed the section.\nAuthorities continue to monitor the situation as rainfall persists, and further updates on road conditions are expected.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nKathmandu\nHighway\nhelpline\narmed police\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nNarayanghat-Butwal section, Kanti Highway disrupted\n5 months ago\nEast-West highway obstructed\n5 months ago\n7 Nepali feature films that shone globally\n2 years ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nAryatara chosen as new Kumari\nFire rages near Kasthamandap, largely under control\n6 safe meat practices to prevent food poisoning this Dashain\nPhulpati being observed today\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nSociety\nFlood risks in Kathmandu, KMC launches helpline service\n8 hours ago\nDisaster\nOver 7,000 Armed Police deployed for disaster response, public alerts in 63 districts\n8 hours ago\nSociety\nHighways blocked nationwide as heavy rainfall disrupts travel\n8 hours ago\nSociety\nTravel in and out of Kathmandu Valley halted for 3 days\n8 hours ago\nEconomy\nCAA publishes domestic airfare rates, Kathmandu–Dhangadhi at Rs 17,579\n1 day ago",
