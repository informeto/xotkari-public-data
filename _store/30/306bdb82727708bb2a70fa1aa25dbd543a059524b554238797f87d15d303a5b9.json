Revered as a symbol of Goddess Bhawani, the Living Goddess Kumari is honored as a divine presence.\nOn the night of Maha Nawami, Kumari was taken for the traditional darshan of Taleju Bhawani, a ritual believed to bestow her with special spiritual power. This midnight visit to Taleju temple is a centuries-old practice.\nAs Dashain tika and jamara are considered the prasad of Goddess Durga, the Nepal Panchang Nirnayak Samitee has clarified that ordinary people do not need to follow a specific time to receive it. However, for those who seek an auspicious moment, 11:53 AM has been designated as the most favorable hour today.\nMeanwhile, Prime Minister Sushila Karki will not be receiving or offering tika this year, her secretariat confirmed.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nAryatara chosen as new Kumari\n4 days ago\nOf Gods and Goddesses: Kathmandu readies for the spectacle of Indra Jatra\n4 weeks ago\nA day in the life of Lalitpur’s Living Goddess\n6 years ago\nA sarod maestro’s offering to the Living Goddess\n7 years ago\nNepal’s new ‘Living Goddess’ enters holy temple for first time\n8 years ago\nFrom the Kathmandu Press: Sunday, September 24, 2017\n8 years ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nNepal’s Gen Z movement captures French media and inspires protesters\nFinance Ministry launches digital approval system\nEducation Minister issues four-point instruction to CTEVT\nIntellectual Council urges Oli to hand over UML leadership via central committee\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nSociety\nMonsoon triggers flood and landslide risks in several districts, DHM issues special alert\n16 hours ago\nFestival\nLiving Goddess Kumari to offer Dashain Tika to public today\n16 hours ago\nFestival\nNepalis celebrate Bijaya Dashami, auspicious Tika time set at 11:53 am\n16 hours ago\nBlog\nClay and culture: The making of Durga idols\n2 days ago\nFestival\nTaleju Temple welcomes devotees on Maha Nawami\n2 days ago",
