According to trader Chitra Bahadur Silwal, transportation costs have increased as local governments along the Mustang–Kathmandu route impose taxes at different points.\nHe said the animals are sold only after veterinary doctors conduct health checks. The Department of Livestock Services has arranged health inspections of livestock and poultry at Sallaghari from September 22 to October 1.\nMeanwhile, the Food Management and Trading Company has announced that it will not be selling goats, rams, or chyāngra this year.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nDashain\njustice\nelephant\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission\ngovernment\nPrison\nGen-Z\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nDashain and the celebration of the sacred feminine amid social ironies\n4 hours ago\nGhatasthapana performed at Hanumandhoka, marking the start of Dashain festival (Photos)\n3 days ago\nWhat are the chances of rain during Dashain this year?\n4 days ago\nDashain Tika auspicious time at 11:53 am on October 2\n1 week ago\nNo advance ticket bookings for Dashain\n1 week ago\nDiscussion on opening Dashain advance ticket booking today\n2 weeks ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nHamas releases farewell picture of 48 hostages including Nepali Bipin Joshi\n8 grand architectural marvels of the Rana Era\nData of smart licenses safe, printing to begin\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nSociety\nJustice remains elusive as survivors file thousands of sexual violence complaints\n4 hours ago\nOpinion\nDashain and the celebration of the sacred feminine amid social ironies\n4 hours ago\nPolitics\nGovernment bans foreign travel, cuts facilities in austerity push\n5 hours ago\nOpinion\nPost Gen Z Protests: Is the country dancing on the pinhead?
