  "content": "Custom valuation to end, transactions to be based on actual invoices\nOnlinekhabar\nWednesday, September 24, 2025\n0\nComments\nKathmandu, September 24\nThe government is set to replace the customs system based on reference values for imports with a new system that levies customs duties according to actual invoices.\nAccording to the Department of Customs, an online valuation database system will be piloted in Biratnagar from Wednesday, before being gradually expanded to all customs offices nationwide. Finance Minister and Minister for Federal Affairs and General Administration Rameshwar Khanal will officially launch the system in Biratnagar.\nThe online valuation database will record, store, and analyse import data to help customs offices verify declared values and reduce the risk of under-valuation. It will calculate 90-day average prices of goods and provide updated real-market values, aligning Nepal’s system with international standards.\n“Importers declare the prices they have paid for goods, and this system will help verify whether the declaration is accurate,” said Customs Director General Shyam Prasad Bhandari. “Once this system is in place, the outdated reference pricing mechanism will be phased out.”\nThe reference pricing system, introduced in 2007 and made mandatory in 2018 under the Customs Valuation Guidelines, was intended to curb under-reporting. However, businesses complained that it often set arbitrary prices higher or lower than real transaction values, creating discrepancies and adding administrative burdens.\nTraders argued that the system discouraged fair trade and even contributed to capital flight. They had long demanded its removal. With the shift to actual valuation, businesses expect smoother operations and greater confidence. The new budget had also included a commitment to abolish reference pricing.\nThe government also plans to introduce a “Trusted Trader” scheme to reward compliant importers. Those on the list selected based on timely tax payment and clean compliance records will receive preferential treatment such as simplified customs clearance, reduced document requirements, and international recognition as trusted businesses.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nNepal\nLandslide\nDashain\nelection\nprotest\nMuglin\nGen-Z\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nHamas releases farewell picture of 48 hostages including Nepali Bipin Joshi\nNew Gen-Z party could emerge in support of Balen\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nOpinion\nPost Gen Z Protests: Is the country dancing on the pinhead?
