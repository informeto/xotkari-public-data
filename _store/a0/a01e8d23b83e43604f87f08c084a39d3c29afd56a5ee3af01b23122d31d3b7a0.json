  "content": "Misleading news affects mental health, ways to cope\nSumitra Luitel\nFriday, September 26, 2025\n0\nComments\nNot all the information we receive is accurate. Rumours have long spread in society through word of mouth, but with the rise of social media, misleading and false information now spreads much faster and more widely. When people believe such misinformation, it shapes false perceptions and contributes to distortions in society.\nThis has become a global problem. In Nepal too, during the recent Gen Z protests, many incidents occurred as a result of people believing in misleading information. Even during and after the protests, false news continued to circulate.\nFor example, on platforms like TikTok, Facebook, and Discord, exaggerated or fabricated claims inflated the number of demonstrators, the scale of violence, and the figures of those injured. Such misinformation on social media and in the media affected millions of people directly and indirectly.\nAccording to a World Health Organization review, during pandemics or crises, misinformation negatively influences health behaviours and significantly impacts mental health. In Nepal, false claims such as “India has sent troops to Nepal” during the\nGen Z movement\nspread fear and panic among ordinary people.\nPsychiatrists warn that such misleading or exaggerated information causes immediate stress and can lead to long-term mental health problems. It deeply affects the human psyche, especially among young people.\nImmediate impacts: Stress and trauma\nPsychologist Binod Dhakal says misinformation and graphic content circulating during protests cause psychological trauma. “When misleading and exaggerated information spreads on social media, with violent images, people’s distress, or children injured by bullets, it pushes individuals into trauma,” he explained. “This affects daily life. People can’t sleep, or if they do, they relive the events in their dreams.”\nHe adds that such trauma leads to loss of appetite, lack of motivation, and overthinking. Misinformation further alters people’s ways of thinking.\nFor example, during the second day of the protests, a rumour spread that the bodies of 32 missing students had been discovered inside Parliament. Many believed it for several hours, which fueled anger and agitation among protesters and caused additional psychological distress to others.\nPsychiatrist Anmol Karki notes that misinformation reduces morale, increases anxiety, and generates fear and despair. “People struggle with sleeplessness and loss of appetite,” he said. “Even a week after the protests, videos of bleeding victims still circulated on social media, repeatedly triggering psychological impacts.”\nStudies support these observations. Research published in the National Library of Medicine shows that misinformation raises anxiety and psychological stress. According to Karki, repeated exposure to violent or exaggerated news on television or social media can cause “secondary trauma,” where individuals are affected even without being directly involved. During the Gen Z protests, he said, false news created fear among parents and children, disrupting their daily lives.\nLong-term effects: PTSD, depression, and loss of resilience\nContinuous exposure to misleading content turns short-term stress into long-term problems. Dhakal explains that repeatedly viewing such content weakens resilience the ability to return to normal. Over time, this can develop into post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, or anxiety. Protesters may experience flashbacks, nightmares, or constant fear.\nKarki adds that repeated exposure heightens worry about the future, reduces confidence, and disrupts daily activities. Research also shows that media exposure during crises doubles or even triples the risk of PTSD. Some children after the Gen Z movement reportedly developed symptoms such as refusing food, screaming, or being unable to sleep adding to parental stress.\nA Statistics Canada study has also confirmed that misinformation negatively affects public mental health.\nHow to avoid the impact of misinformation\nCuriosity about political and social change is natural, but when curiosity goes unsatisfied, restlessness grows. Dhakal advises relying on official media and government statements to avoid misinformation. “Because social media content can be exaggerated or false, people should check sources like the Nepal Police’s official Facebook page or ministry websites,” he said.\nHe suggests self-care as well: daily exercise, breathing practices, and conversations with family and friends can help release emotions and protect against PTSD. People should remain cautious of sensationalised content and seek more detailed verification before believing or sharing it.\nKarki recommends relying only on official news portals. “When reading a claim, always check the source who said it and where it came from,” he said. “If the source is missing or unclear, it should not be trusted.”\nHe also advises limiting exposure to repeated content and consulting a psychologist or psychiatrist if stress, sleeplessness, or other issues persist. Importantly, viral posts on social media should not be shared without verification, and the authenticity of photos, videos, or screenshots should be checked before circulating them.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nDashain\nManaslu\ndurga\nTaleju\nSumitra Luitel\nLuitel is an Onlinekhabar correspondent covering lifestyle.\nMore From the Author\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\n7 daily habits to improve mental health\n2 months ago\nThe silent epidemic taking young lives in Nepal and across the world\n3 months ago\nWe are not lazy but we are loud: Genz and mental health\n3 months ago\nBeyond hashtags: The silent mental health cries of our youth\n4 months ago\nNepal’s mental health crisis: The urgent need for intervention\n4 months ago\n9 ways to care for your mental health during winter\n9 months ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nNepal’s Gen Z movement captures French media and inspires protesters\nDashain and the celebration of the sacred feminine amid social ironies\nFinance Ministry launches digital approval system\nGovernment bans foreign travel, cuts facilities in austerity push\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nBlog\nClay and culture: The making of Durga idols\n10 hours ago\nFestival\nTaleju Temple welcomes devotees on Maha Nawami\n11 hours ago\nTravel\nManaslu climbing in autumn starts on encouraging note; Nima Chhiring sets new record\n12 hours ago\nFestival\nMaha Astami festival being observed today\n1 day ago\nFood & beverage\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\n1 day ago",
