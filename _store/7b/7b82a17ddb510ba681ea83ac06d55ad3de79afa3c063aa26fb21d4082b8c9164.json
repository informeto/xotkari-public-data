If led by the Head of State or Head of Government, delegations may include up to 10 members, while other official teams will be limited to three.\nIn another major move, the Cabinet barred political officials at federal, provincial, and local levels from appointing advisors. Personal secretaries will only be provided to top office bearers including the President, Vice President, Prime Minister, Speaker, National Assembly Chair, provincial heads, and ministers. Other ministers may appoint a maximum of three staff in their personal secretariat.\nThe government also withdrew additional facilities for ambassadors, restricted the use of multiple vehicles by officials, and directed ministries to reallocate vehicles internally rather than purchase new ones. Procurement of luxury and unnecessary items, as well as distribution-based programs such as gas cylinders and bicycles, has been discontinued.\nTo cut non-productive expenses, the Cabinet suspended low-priority projects, halted allowances for regular meetings, and ordered the use of second-hand vehicles, furniture, and electronic devices. Expenditure on utilities, rent, and consulting services will also be minimised.\nFurthermore, no new organisational structures duplicating existing ones will be created, and the Land Problem Settlement Commission will be dissolved. The National Investigation Department will now operate under the Ministry of Home Affairs, while the Department of Revenue Investigation and Department of Money Laundering Investigation will be restructured under the Ministry of Finance.\nThe Ministry of Finance has instructed all ministries and local bodies to strictly implement the directives, emphasising fiscal discipline, accountability, and economic revival.\n—RSS\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nDashain\njustice\nelephant\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission\ngovernment\nPrison\nmarket\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nGovernment to cover expenses of families of those killed in protests\n2 weeks ago\nDiscussion on government’s policy and programme concludes\n5 months ago\nOver Rs 150 million deposited into government account to aid in post-earthquake rehabilitation\n2 years ago\nThe struggles government faces in adopting new technologies\n2 years ago\nVice President Nanda Bahadur Pun leaves his official residence 2 days before his term ends\n3 years ago\nNepal’s vice president Nanda Bahadur Pun has nothing but frustration as he leaves office\n3 years ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nHamas releases farewell picture of 48 hostages including Nepali Bipin Joshi\n8 grand architectural marvels of the Rana Era\nData of smart licenses safe, printing to begin\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nEconomy\nDealers struggle as Dashain auto market falls silent\n3 hours ago\nSociety\nJustice remains elusive as survivors file thousands of sexual violence complaints\n7 hours ago\nOpinion\nDashain and the celebration of the sacred feminine amid social ironies\n7 hours ago\nPolitics\nGovernment bans foreign travel, cuts facilities in austerity push\n9 hours ago\nOpinion\nPost Gen Z Protests: Is the country dancing on the pinhead?
