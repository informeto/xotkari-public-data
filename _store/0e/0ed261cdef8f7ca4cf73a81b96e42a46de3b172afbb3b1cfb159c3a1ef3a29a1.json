He explained that the preliminary study was based on visual inspections, while a detailed structural damage assessment with the use of equipment will follow to determine reconstruction or rebuilding needs.\n“These courts not only accommodate staff but also bear the heavy load of service seekers. Given the extent of the fire damage, the buildings have been red-stickered,” Dhital said, noting that some rooms, though not directly burned, are still uninhabitable.\nThe inspection team found the basement of the Kathmandu District Court particularly critical, as the fire originated there and burned for 72 hours. The basement, used for storing legal records, sustained severe damage, weakening the foundation. “Normally, a fire should be extinguished within two to three hours, but this time no effective suppression system was in place,” Dhital said.\nHe added that since Nepal is seismically vulnerable, fire-weakened structures could collapse even in minor tremors, making them highly unsafe for public use.\nThe Association has been mobilising volunteers to carry out the first phase of RVDA free of cost, providing quick information on immediate risks and usability. This includes damage observation, risk evaluation, usability checks, alternative management suggestions, and reconstruction feasibility. A detailed study will provide in-depth analysis and recommendations for further steps.\nConcerns over Singh Durbar repainting\nExperts have also raised concerns over the government’s hasty repainting of fire-charred buildings inside Singh Durbar. Dhital warned that buildings appearing intact to the naked eye may have suffered deep internal damage. He noted that the Ministry of Finance has already been repainted, work has begun at the Ministry of Energy, and cleaning has started at the Office of the Prime Minister and Council of Ministers.\n“Without a proper damage assessment, simply applying paint and reoccupying the buildings is highly risky,” Dhital cautioned.\nFinance Ministry spokesperson Tanka Prasad Pandey defended the repainting, saying there was no internal fire damage to the ministry building. “The outer walls turned black due to burning vehicles in the parking lot below, so repainting was done only to remove the soot,” he said.\nInside Singh Durbar, the building in front of the Prime Minister’s Office has been completely destroyed, while the Ministry of Home Affairs and Ministry of Education suffered extensive damage. Several other buildings were partially damaged, and government vehicles inside the compound were heavily affected.\nMore teams to be deployed\nThe\nNepal Engineers’ Association\non Wednesday concluded an orientation training on ‘Post-Fire Rapid Damage Assessment.’ Dhital said trained teams will now be mobilized in groups across different sectors, in coordination with government agencies, to carry out detailed inspections of damaged buildings.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\noath\nMinister\nAchyut Puri\nPuri is a business correspondent at Onlinekhabar.\nMore From the Author\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nFour new ministers take the oath\n12 hours ago\nNearly 200 thousand people leave Kathmandu Valley in five days\n14 hours ago\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n14 hours ago\nGhatasthapana performed at Hanumandhoka, marking the start of Dashain festival (Photos)\n17 hours ago\nInjured Gen Z protesters stage sit-in at Singha Durbar gate (Photos)\n2 days ago\nNepal cricket team receives visa to travel to UAE for historic T20I series against West Indies\n2 days ago\nMost Read\nUAE tightens visit visa rules for Nepalis\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n4 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n12 hours ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n14 hours ago\nCulture\nGhatasthapana performed at Hanumandhoka, marking the start of Dashain festival (Photos)\n17 hours ago\nPolitics\nInjured Gen Z protesters stage sit-in at Singha Durbar gate (Photos)\n2 days ago\nFestival\nWhat are the chances of rain during Dashain this year?\n2 days ago",
