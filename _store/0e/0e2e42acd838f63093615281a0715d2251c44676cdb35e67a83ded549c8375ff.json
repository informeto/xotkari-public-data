The world’s seventh highest mountain, Mt Dhaulagiri (8,167 meters), is located in Dhaulagiri Rural Municipality-4 of Myagdi.\nThe Department of Tourism said royalty of Rs 5 million 71 thousand has been received from those who obtained permission for the Dhaulagiri ascent. Foreign mountaineers wishing to climb 8,000 meters high mountains besides Mt Everest in the spring season must pay royalty of 900 USD per person.\nThe climbing royalty for other smaller peaks ranges between minimum 125 USD and maximum 400 USD. Three hundred seventy-four people have obtained permission to climb Mt Manaslu (8,163 meters high) located in Gorkha in this autumn, the Department said.\nThe Manaslu mountain has been the choice of climbers in the autumn season. The number of people obtaining climbing permits for Dhaulagiriis in second place. Mountaineers, Sherpas, guides, porters, and support staff have started reaching the base camp, said Hari Prasad Tilija, a ward member of Dhaulagiri-4, who also runs a hotel at the Italian base camp.\nThis time the expedition teams have set out for the base camp from Marpha in Mustang, via Yak Kharka. They have used the trail of Mustang as the route through Mudi Bagar of DhaulagiriRural Municipality is damaged, winding, and distant.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nDashain\njustice\nelephant\nTruth and Reconciliation Commission\ngovernment\nPrison\nGen-Z\nRastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS)\nRSS is a government-run national news portal of Nepal.\nMore From the Author\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nHamas releases farewell picture of 48 hostages including Nepali Bipin Joshi\n8 grand architectural marvels of the Rana Era\nData of smart licenses safe, printing to begin\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nSociety\nJustice remains elusive as survivors file thousands of sexual violence complaints\n3 hours ago\nOpinion\nDashain and the celebration of the sacred feminine amid social ironies\n4 hours ago\nPolitics\nGovernment bans foreign travel, cuts facilities in austerity push\n5 hours ago\nOpinion\nPost Gen Z Protests: Is the country dancing on the pinhead?
