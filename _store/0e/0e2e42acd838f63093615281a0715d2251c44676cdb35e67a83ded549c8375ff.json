The world’s seventh highest mountain, Mt Dhaulagiri (8,167 meters), is located in Dhaulagiri Rural Municipality-4 of Myagdi.\nThe Department of Tourism said royalty of Rs 5 million 71 thousand has been received from those who obtained permission for the Dhaulagiri ascent. Foreign mountaineers wishing to climb 8,000 meters high mountains besides Mt Everest in the spring season must pay royalty of 900 USD per person.\nThe climbing royalty for other smaller peaks ranges between minimum 125 USD and maximum 400 USD. Three hundred seventy-four people have obtained permission to climb Mt Manaslu (8,163 meters high) located in Gorkha in this autumn, the Department said.\nThe Manaslu mountain has been the choice of climbers in the autumn season. The number of people obtaining climbing permits for Dhaulagiriis in second place. Mountaineers, Sherpas, guides, porters, and support staff have started reaching the base camp, said Hari Prasad Tilija, a ward member of Dhaulagiri-4, who also runs a hotel at the Italian base camp.\nThis time the expedition teams have set out for the base camp from Marpha in Mustang, via Yak Kharka. They have used the trail of Mustang as the route through Mudi Bagar of DhaulagiriRural Municipality is damaged, winding, and distant.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nRastriya Samachar Samiti (RSS)\nRSS is a government-run national news portal of Nepal.\nMore From the Author\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n13 hours ago\nInterview\nEva Maria Belser: Even a small country can practice effective federalism\n15 hours ago\nOpinion\nHow foreign companies can register a branch office in Nepal\n15 hours ago\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n1 day ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n2 days ago",
