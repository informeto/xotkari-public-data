Districts in Madhesh Province, including Bara, Parsa, Sarlahi, and Rautahat, have been listed as high-risk areas as well.\nDue to the high likelihood of sudden river surges in these districts, the department has issued a special bulletin requesting heightened vigilance from October 4–6.\nCurrent analysis indicates that the flow in the Narayani, Bagmati, Kamala, and Koshi rivers, along with their tributaries, may increase significantly, potentially reaching dangerous levels.\nIn addition, smaller rivers and streams flowing through the Mahabharat and Chure ranges in Koshi, Bagmati, Gandaki, Lumbini, and Madhesh provinces may experience sudden surges.\nThe heavy rainfall could lead to floods, inundation, landslides, soil erosion, and possible disruptions in road and air transportation.\nThe DHM has urged the public to stay attentive to regular updated forecasts and early warnings issued by the department and to take necessary precautions to minimize potential damage.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nKathmandu\nHighway\nhelpline\narmed police\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nOne month of monsoon: 674 incidents, 31 deaths, 112 injuries\n3 months ago\nMonsoon system spreads across the country from today\n4 months ago\nRainfall on Friday morning causes waterlogging in Lalitpur (Photos)\n4 months ago\nOver 2 million citizens, 450,000 households likely to be affected by disasters this monsoon\n4 months ago\nMonsoon-induced disasters claim lives of 182\n1 year ago\nMonsoon activity to intensify in Nepal, red alert issued for 36 districts\n1 year ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nAryatara chosen as new Kumari\nFire rages near Kasthamandap, largely under control\n6 safe meat practices to prevent food poisoning this Dashain\nHistoric triumph as Nepal beats West Indies in T20I\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nSociety\nFlood risks in Kathmandu, KMC launches helpline service\n4 hours ago\nDisaster\nOver 7,000 Armed Police deployed for disaster response, public alerts in 63 districts\n4 hours ago\nSociety\nHighways blocked nationwide as heavy rainfall disrupts travel\n4 hours ago\nSociety\nTravel in and out of Kathmandu Valley halted for 3 days\n4 hours ago\nEconomy\nCAA publishes domestic airfare rates, Kathmandu–Dhangadhi at Rs 17,579\n1 day ago",
