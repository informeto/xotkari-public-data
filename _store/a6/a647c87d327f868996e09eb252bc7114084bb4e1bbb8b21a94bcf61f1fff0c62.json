Officials believe the digital system will reduce the time spent on paperwork and increase overall effectiveness.\nAccording to the ministry, the initiative is part of the government’s broader plan to implement a paperless administration. The Finance Ministry has made it mandatory to use the Integrated Office Management System, developed by the Department of Information Technology under the Ministry of Communication and Information Technology, to carry out official tasks in a simple, fast, efficient, cost-effective, transparent, and effective manner.\nThrough this system, decisions on memos and orders, registration and dispatch of letters, attendance, leave and deputation approvals, and record management must all be processed electronically using digital signatures.\nThe ministry expects the new system to accelerate decision-making, reduce costs, and strengthen transparency and accountability in its operations.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nRs 50 million allocated for preparation of ICC Men’s T20 World Cup\n2 years ago\nThe unattended issue of road safety in Nepal\n2 years ago\nGovt removing Rs 120 million cap on margin loans\n2 years ago\nProjects under MCC expected to start on August 30\n2 years ago\n1.5 months away from the end, govt’s capital budget spending hits 36% of annual target\n2 years ago\nUnderperforming govt spends 33% of the annual development budget in 10 months\n2 years ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nNepal’s Gen Z movement captures French media and inspires protesters\nFinance Ministry launches digital approval system\nIntellectual Council urges Oli to hand over UML leadership via central committee\nMisleading news affects mental health, ways to cope\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nBlog\nClay and culture: The making of Durga idols\n22 hours ago\nFestival\nTaleju Temple welcomes devotees on Maha Nawami\n23 hours ago\nTravel\nManaslu climbing in autumn starts on encouraging note; Nima Chhiring sets new record\n1 day ago\nFestival\nMaha Astami festival being observed today\n2 days ago\nFood & beverage\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\n2 days ago",
