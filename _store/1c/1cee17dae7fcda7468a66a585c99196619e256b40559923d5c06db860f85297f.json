It is one of the biggest Hindu festivals celebrated in Nepal.\nGhatasthapana\nmarks the first day of Bada Dashain and falls on Aswin Shukla Pratipada, the first day of the bright half of the lunar calendar month Asoj or Kartik. According to the Nepal Calendar Fixation Committee, the auspicious time for observing Ghatasthapana this year is at 9:13 am.\nOn the occasion of Gathasthapana, a team from the Nepal Army played the Mangal Dhun and celebrated the ritual with joy.\nEarly Monday morning, after completing daily rituals, devotees collected sand or soil from a nearby river or a clean place, placed it in a sanctified room or the Dashain Ghar smeared with cow dung, and sowed barley seeds on it. The sprouting of these seeds is called Jamara. On the day of Dashain Tika, this Jamara is received as the blessing of the Goddess.\nAccording to scriptures, Ghatasthapana should be performed on the day of Pratipada during sunrise. Based on this belief, the Nepal Calendar Fixation Committee declared today as Ghatasthapana.\nDuring the nine days of\nNavaratri\n, three forms of Goddess Durga, Mahakali, Mahalaxmi, and Mahasaraswati, are ritually invoked and worshipped at the site of Ghatasthapana.\nAs per tradition, after Ghatasthapana at the Dashain Ghar of Hanumandhoka Palace, daily animal sacrifices are offered throughout Navaratri, accompanied by ritual worship of Goddess Durga and the playing of the Mangal Dhun, according to officials of the Hanumandhoka Durbar Care Office.\nOn the main day of Dashain, i.e., Dashami, the Jamara along with Tika is applied as the blessing of Goddess Durga. This year, Dashain Tika falls on October 2, and the auspicious time for Tika has been fixed at 11:53 a.m., as announced by the Nepal Calendar Fixation Committee.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nNepal\nLandslide\nDashain\nelection\nprotest\nMuglin\ncustom\nChandra Bahadur Ale\nAle is a photojournalist at Onlinekhabar.\nMore From the Author\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nSheep and Himalayan goats brought to Sallaghari, Bhaktapur for Dashain\n2 hours ago\nWhat are the chances of rain during Dashain this year?\n3 days ago\nDashain Tika auspicious time at 11:53 am on October 2\n6 days ago\nNo advance ticket bookings for Dashain\n1 week ago\nDiscussion on opening Dashain advance ticket booking today\n1 week ago\n7 evergreen songs for your Deusi-Bhailo programme this Tihar\n11 months ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nNew Gen-Z party could emerge in support of Balen\nHamas releases farewell picture of 48 hostages including Nepali Bipin Joshi\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nGovernment moves ahead with election preparations while major parties remain uncertain\n2 hours ago\nPolitics\nCustom valuation to end, transactions to be based on actual invoices\n3 hours ago\nOpinion\nFrom rubble to resilience: Can Nepal’s banks power a post-Gen Z protest recovery?\n3 hours ago\nDisaster\nLandslide clearance begins on Narayangadh- Muglin Road\n3 hours ago\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n1 day ago",
