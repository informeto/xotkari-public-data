Vulnerable communities have been urged to remain alert.\nThe city office has also launched a helpline service for residents to report disaster-related problems immediately. Citizens can contact 16600105511, 015901764, or 015901763 to inform authorities of any issues.\nAuthorities confirmed that these helplines are open for anyone facing emergency problems.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nKathmandu\nHighway\nhelpline\narmed police\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nAryatara chosen as new Kumari\nFire rages near Kasthamandap, largely under control\n6 safe meat practices to prevent food poisoning this Dashain\nHistoric triumph as Nepal beats West Indies in T20I\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nSociety\nFlood risks in Kathmandu, KMC launches helpline service\n2 hours ago\nDisaster\nOver 7,000 Armed Police deployed for disaster response, public alerts in 63 districts\n2 hours ago\nSociety\nHighways blocked nationwide as heavy rainfall disrupts travel\n2 hours ago\nSociety\nTravel in and out of Kathmandu Valley halted for 3 days\n2 hours ago\nEconomy\nCAA publishes domestic airfare rates, Kathmandu–Dhangadhi at Rs 17,579\n1 day ago",
