According to religious customs, the ritual of offering tika and jamara as prasad of Goddess Navadurga continues until Kojagrat Purnima, provided that the concluding sacrifices are not yet performed.\nDashain, also known as Bada Dashain, is celebrated for 15 days from the first day of the bright lunar fortnight of Ashwin to Kojagrat Purnima. On Bijaya Dashami, family members and respected elders bestow tika and jamara as blessings. Those who cannot meet their relatives on that day often exchange blessings until Kojagrat Purnima.\nThe tika ceremony officially begins on Bijaya Dashami morning after the ritual immersion of the goddess, following Vedic rites conducted on the kalash (sacred vessel) established at the Dashain household shrine on the first day of the festival.\nBedmani Bhattarai, a member of the Nepal Panchang Nirnayak Samiti, explained that while some families perform tika only on Bijaya Dashami, others continue the practice until Kojagrat Purnima. “Nepali traditions are diverse and distinct,” he said. “In eastern and central Nepal, tika is commonly given until the full moon, while in many parts of western Nepal, it is customary to accept tika only on the day after Durga Bisarjan. These variations should be respected as part of each community’s unique tradition.”\nMeanwhile, Ashwin Shukla Ekadashi is being observed today as Papankusha Ekadashi. According to religious belief, fasting on this day absolves sins committed knowingly or unknowingly in the past.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nDashain\nelection\nincident\ndomestic\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMore than 5.5 lakh people exit Valley for Dashain\n2 days ago\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\n3 days ago\nDashain and the celebration of the sacred feminine amid social ironies\n1 week ago\nSheep and Himalayan goats brought to Sallaghari, Bhaktapur for Dashain\n1 week ago\nGhatasthapana performed at Hanumandhoka, marking the start of Dashain festival (Photos)\n2 weeks ago\nWhat are the chances of rain during Dashain this year?\n2 weeks ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nAryatara chosen as new Kumari\nFire rages near Kasthamandap, largely under control\nHistoric triumph as Nepal beats West Indies in T20I\n6 safe meat practices to prevent food poisoning this Dashain\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nEconomy\nCAA publishes domestic airfare rates, Kathmandu–Dhangadhi at Rs 17,579\n11 hours ago\nPolitics\nElection schedule to change: Provincial and local polls to follow federal elections\n11 hours ago\nFestival\nDashain Tika continues on Ekadashi Day\n11 hours ago\nSociety\nMonsoon triggers flood and landslide risks in several districts, DHM issues special alert\n1 day ago\nFestival\nLiving Goddess Kumari to offer Dashain Tika to public today\n1 day ago",
