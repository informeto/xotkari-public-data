  "content": "Nepal’s Gen Z movement captures French media and inspires protesters\nOscar Gruson\nFriday, September 26, 2025\nNoé Devos\nFriday, September 26, 2025\n0\nComments\nIn France, Nepal is mostly known for Mount Everest, with numerous articles from newspapers like Le Monde dedicated to that topic. Politically, however, the country remains widely unknown. The\nGen Z uprising\n, that held on September 8 and 9, came as a shock, even to those who closely follow current events.\nLili, a journalism student says, “It was the first time I’d seen this country in the news.”\nOn September 12 Yann Barthès — host of one of France’s biggest talk shows, Quotidien, talked about the Gen Z revolution in Nepal, which was viewed by 1.26 million viewers.\nIn the heart of this historic event, Quotidien highlighted the symbolic weight of the absence of Western journalists in Nepal, another reminder of a country nearly forgotten in global media, overshadowed by China, India, and the rest of the world. This lack of context led to a potentially skewed perception of the violent protests in Kathmandu.\nIn the age of social media and the race for sensational footage, many French viewers admitted they had seen the dramatic videos before understanding the actual stakes of the protests and the people’s deep-seated distrust toward what they see as a corrupt government.\nMany Nepalese, in attempting to explain the situation, described their country as deeply poor, miming the act of stuffing money into pockets, and pointing fingers at their government.\nPresent in Nepal during this surreal week, we found it hard to depict Kathmandu as a mere representation of popular fury. In more remote neighborhoods, life had stopped. Shops were closed, eyes glued to phones, young people wore police hats playfully — yet the youngest kids kept playing impromptu street soccer matches, far from the destruction and chaos portrayed by the media.\nYes, chaos happened, but even in the midst of a popular uprising, it was targeted and did not involve the entire Nepalis population.\nAll eyes on Gen Z revolution\nFollowing the events, articles on the Nepal situation flooded the largest French newspapers.\nLibération\npublished as many articles in one week as it had since the start of 2025. Likewise,\nLe Figaro\n, another major French outlet, released a full series on the revolution, despite having mentioned Nepal only a few times earlier in the year.\nAmid ongoing protests in France, Nepal’s uprising echoed across social media. The French government, deeply unpopular, was confronted with images of a toppled Nepali regime, with ministers resigning in just three days.\nFrench media outlets on X posted footage from Kathmandu: “Nepali protesters now armed with rifles.”  In the comments, users replied: “That’s what we’ll have to do tomorrow,” referring to the upcoming demonstrations in France.\nOne post showed the Nepalese Finance Minister being chased by protesters into a river, the video racking up 1.8 million views. The comments in the post read: “We should do the same with Bayrou (then Prime Minister) and Retailleau (then Interior Minister).” In reality, this video was just a rumor that many French internet users believed. These surreal beliefs led some French people to want to carry out similar actions, even though they were nothing but fake news.These threats, drowned in the flood of X content, now advocating total free speech\nsince Elon Musk’s takeover, are nonetheless revealing of the public’s frustration and a\nwillingness to follow Nepal’s example.\nThe Nepali inspiration\nOn September 18, over 500,000 people\nmarched across France to protest political instability, according to government estimates, though union CGT claimed over a million participants.\nAmong the protesters, some drew unexpected inspiration from Nepal’s Gen Z movement. While there are similarities between the two situations, the motivations and consequences differ greatly.\n“Did you see the images of the Nepalese Parliament in flames? The stars are aligning,” declared Anasse, a SUD-Rail unionist specializing in train workers’ conditions, to thunderous applause. A video of Anasse posted by a Le Figaro journalist on X shows him rallying the crowd, citing Nepal’s youth as a symbol, and he’s not alone in doing so.\nThis is also the case for Lucca, a French-Brazilian student who took part in the demonstration and gave his testimony on the World Socialist Web site. He says, “Everyone must come out and demonstrate, because today, everyone is affected. Everyone must mobilise, we must do as they did in Nepal.”\nOne Le Figaro headline reads: “We Burn Trash Bins, Then We’ll Burn Matignon Like in Nepal,” quoting a protester eager to force change through radical means.\nStill, French protests remain far more peaceful and controlled than those in Nepal. The September 18 demonstrations went off mostly without incident, thanks to heavy police presence. Interior Minister Bruno Retailleau\nstated: “In most cases, the protests were conducted under proper conditions.”\nNevertheless, the day saw 309 arrests and 134 detentions, with 10 protesters and one journalist injured. These numbers are significant but pale in comparison to the heavy toll in Nepal: 74 dead and hundreds injured in a single week.\nA clear contrast is seen in SUD-Rail’s intrusion into France’s Ministry of Economy and Finance, inspired by Nepalese actions. The French protesters entered Bercy, demanding change from officials directly. But in true French fashion, they stayed for only ten minutes, left peacefully, and caused no damage, a far cry from the burning of Parliament in Kathmandu or the physical abuse of ministers.\nThe core demands also differ. Nepalis are protesting corruption and nepotism\nin government and administration. The French, on the other hand, are demonstrating across many sectors for better working conditions and against political paralysis.\nAnd the outcomes? France is far from achieving what Nepal’s Gen Z accomplished. While Nepal saw a temporary governmental shift and a glimmer of hop\ne\nfor the future, France remains stuck in a murky political limbo\nwith little progress. The latest Prime Minister switch hasn’t convinced many, and a more stable future still seems out of reach.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nOscar Gruson\nGruson is a French journalist.\nMore From the Author\nNoé Devos\nDevos is a French journalist.\nMore From the Author\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nKP Oli makes first public appearance since resignation\n1 week ago\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n1 week ago\nInjured Gen Z protesters stage sit-in at Singha Durbar gate (Photos)\n2 weeks ago\nGold smuggling kingpin Gore escapes from prison\n3 weeks ago\nSecurity forces airlift senior leaders amid Gen Z protest\n3 weeks ago\nGen Z takes to the streets against corruption, mismanagement, and social media ban (Photo Feature)\n3 weeks ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nNepal’s Gen Z movement captures French media and inspires protesters\nFinance Ministry launches digital approval system\nIntellectual Council urges Oli to hand over UML leadership via central committee\nMisleading news affects mental health, ways to cope\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nBlog\nClay and culture: The making of Durga idols\n22 hours ago\nFestival\nTaleju Temple welcomes devotees on Maha Nawami\n23 hours ago\nTravel\nManaslu climbing in autumn starts on encouraging note; Nima Chhiring sets new record\n24 hours ago\nFestival\nMaha Astami festival being observed today\n2 days ago\nFood & beverage\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\n2 days ago",
