The committee has advised that the person receiving tika should face east while the one applying it should face west. The tika ceremony begins with a Vedic ritual using the sacred vessel (ghada) established on Ghatasthapana.\nOn this day, people receive tika, jamara, and prasad from gurus, grandparents, parents, and elders with blessings for prosperity, longevity, and enhanced capabilities. Those unable to receive tika today may do so until Kojagrat Purnima, when jamara grown during Ghatasthapana is considered a symbol of prosperity.\nThe auspicious time for Durga Bisarjan (immersion of the goddess) was set for 9:23 am, while state officials are required to take tika precisely at 11:53 am, informed Dr Basudev Koirala of the committee. While common people may receive tika at any time as it is considered the blessing of Goddess Bhagwati, an auspicious hour is specifically fixed for the state leadership.\nAnother committee member, Devmani Bhattarai, explained that Durga Bisarjan must be performed before the tika ritual. However, those compelled to travel can complete the immersion early in the morning and then receive tika.\nDashain concludes on Kojagrat Purnima after the worship of Goddess Mahalaxmi. The festival is observed across Nepal and by Nepali communities abroad.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nDashain\nelection\nincident\ndomestic\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nCAA publishes domestic airfare rates, Kathmandu–Dhangadhi at Rs 17,579\n5 hours ago\nSeparate road and vehicle incidents claim lives in UK and Nepal\n5 hours ago\nElection schedule to change: Provincial and local polls to follow federal elections\n5 hours ago\nDashain Tika continues on Ekadashi Day\n5 hours ago\nMonsoon triggers flood and landslide risks in several districts, DHM issues special alert\n1 day ago\nLiving Goddess Kumari to offer Dashain Tika to public today\n1 day ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nAryatara chosen as new Kumari\nFire rages near Kasthamandap, largely under control\nHistoric triumph as Nepal beats West Indies in T20I\n6 safe meat practices to prevent food poisoning this Dashain\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nEconomy\nCAA publishes domestic airfare rates, Kathmandu–Dhangadhi at Rs 17,579\n5 hours ago\nPolitics\nElection schedule to change: Provincial and local polls to follow federal elections\n5 hours ago\nFestival\nDashain Tika continues on Ekadashi Day\n5 hours ago\nSociety\nMonsoon triggers flood and landslide risks in several districts, DHM issues special alert\n1 day ago\nFestival\nLiving Goddess Kumari to offer Dashain Tika to public today\n1 day ago",
