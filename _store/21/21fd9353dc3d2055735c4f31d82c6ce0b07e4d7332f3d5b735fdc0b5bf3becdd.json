It amends Section 4(2)(2) of the Voter List Act, which had barred registration after the announcement of an election date.\nAccording to the previous provision, “once the date of election is announced, no voter registration shall be made for that election.” This legal hurdle had prevented eligible citizens particularly youth who recently reached voting age from being listed in the voter roll.\nElection Commission spokesperson Suman Ghimire said that after the ordinance, the commission will take necessary decisions and announce dates for voter registration. “With this ordinance, the way has opened for eligible citizens to register in the voter list,” he said.\nThe interim government formed following the Gen Z youth movement had declared fresh elections for March 5. Many young people who played a role in the political change had not yet been registered as voters despite being eligible. The ordinance was brought to address this gap and ensure broader participation in the election.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nNepal\nLandslide\nDashain\nelection\nprotest\nMuglin\ncustom\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nNew Gen-Z party could emerge in support of Balen\nHamas releases farewell picture of 48 hostages including Nepali Bipin Joshi\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nGovernment moves ahead with election preparations while major parties remain uncertain\n3 hours ago\nPolitics\nCustom valuation to end, transactions to be based on actual invoices\n4 hours ago\nOpinion\nFrom rubble to resilience: Can Nepal’s banks power a post-Gen Z protest recovery?\n4 hours ago\nDisaster\nLandslide clearance begins on Narayangadh- Muglin Road\n4 hours ago\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n1 day ago",
