Engineer Krishna Acharya of the office said that if the flow of dry landslides stops, the road could be reopened by 3 pm today.\nCurrently, two machines from the Muglin side and two from the Narayangadh side are being used to remove the debris. Since there is no space to add more equipment, only four machines are being used.\nAccording to Engineer Acharya, about 35 meters of landslide deposit still remains on the road. If it can be cleared smoothly, the road will be open by afternoon.\n“Landslides are occurring from time to time, which poses risks, but we are working continuously. There is no certainty when more debris might fall,” Acharya said, adding that “the problem is caused by loose rocks in the upper part.”\nA massive landslide around 6 pm on September 19 has been continuously falling, leaving hundreds of vehicles stranded on the way from Muglin to Narayangadh and vice versa.\nAccording to the Chitwan District Traffic Police Office, vehicles heading from Bharatpur have been stopped at Tandi, Bhandara, Ampatari, Jugedi, and Ramnagar.\nVehicles coming from Kathmandu have been stopped at Kurintar, Muglin, and Fishling. For passengers stuck at Muglin Bazaar, the Jaycees Ichchhakamana has started distributing free drinking water, meals, and snacks.\nOn the Narayangadh side as well, various social organizations and individuals have been distributing noodles, biscuits, and water to passengers. Transport entrepreneurs have also arranged free meals and snacks for transport workers.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\ngold\nFederalism\nkp oli\noath\ngen z protest\nMinister\nEva Maria Belser\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nBeni-Jomsom and Beni-Darbang roads obstructed by landslide\n1 month ago\nLandslide blocks Araniko Highway again\n2 months ago\nDumre-Ambukhaireni road section blocked by landslide\n2 months ago\n11 national highways completely blocked\n2 months ago\nContinuous rain triggers landslide halting traffic on Araniko Highway\n2 months ago\nFloods and landslides obstruct highways\n3 months ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n4 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n40 minutes ago\nInterview\nEva Maria Belser: Even a small country can practice effective federalism\n3 hours ago\nOpinion\nHow foreign companies can register a branch office in Nepal\n3 hours ago\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n22 hours ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n24 hours ago",
