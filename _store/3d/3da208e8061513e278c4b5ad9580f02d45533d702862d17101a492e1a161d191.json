Hampshire Police confirmed that both victims died at the scene.\nThe driver, a 66-year-old man from Buckingham, was arrested on suspicion of causing death by careless driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. Police have appealed for eyewitnesses and requested any CCTV or dashcam footage related to the crash. The incident, occurring during the Dashain festival period, has left the large Nepali community in Aldershot deeply shaken. Dr Bishal Gurung, General Secretary of Tamu Dhee UK, expressed condolences and urged locals to cooperate with the ongoing investigation.\nMeanwhile, in Manchester, northern England, two people were killed and three others seriously injured after a car rammed into a crowd outside a Jewish place of worship on Thursday. The suspect, identified by police as 35-year-old British national of Syrian origin, Jihad al-Shami, drove into worshippers outside the Heaton Park Hebrew Congregation during the Jewish holy day of Yom Kippur. Following the crash, he also launched a knife attack before being shot dead by police. Two others have been arrested in connection with the incident.\nManchester Police and British Prime Minister Keir Starmer have labeled the attack as a “terrorist incident.” Starmer cut short his visit to Denmark, returned home, and chaired an emergency meeting, ordering tighter security at Jewish places of worship across the UK.\nIn Nepal, a bus accident in Bardibas Municipality of Mahottari district, claimed the life of an 80-year-old local man, identified as Chulhai Chaudhary, and left 20 others injured, four of them critically. The bus, operating on the Kathmandu–Khairmara route, was headed towards Kathmandu when it crashed on Thursday morning. Police have not yet determined the cause and said investigations are underway.\nAuthorities in both the UK and Nepal are continuing investigations into these tragic incidents, which highlight growing concerns about road safety and public security.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nAryatara chosen as new Kumari\nFire rages near Kasthamandap, largely under control\nHistoric triumph as Nepal beats West Indies in T20I\n6 safe meat practices to prevent food poisoning this Dashain\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nEconomy\nCAA publishes domestic airfare rates, Kathmandu–Dhangadhi at Rs 17,579\n24 hours ago\nPolitics\nElection schedule to change: Provincial and local polls to follow federal elections\n1 day ago\nFestival\nDashain Tika continues on Ekadashi Day\n1 day ago\nSociety\nMonsoon triggers flood and landslide risks in several districts, DHM issues special alert\n2 days ago\nFestival\nLiving Goddess Kumari to offer Dashain Tika to public today\n2 days ago",
