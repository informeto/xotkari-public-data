  "content": "6 safe meat practices to prevent food poisoning this Dashain\nOnlinekhabar\nMonday, September 29, 2025\n0\nComments\nNepal is in the midst of Dashain celebrations. People working or studying away from home are returning to their families, gatherings have begun, and many are either traveling or preparing to travel. Meat is one of the most consumed foods during Dashain. Except for vegetarians, most households enjoy meat at nearly every meal of the festival.\nMany families slaughter animals at home to store large quantities of meat. With such abundance, the risk of spoilage increases if meat is not properly handled and stored, making it potentially toxic and harmful to health.\nUnsafe slaughtering practices, poor hygiene, and improper or insufficient storage methods create breeding grounds for harmful bacteria, which may lead to foodborne illnesses, some of them severe.\nFood poisoning from contaminated meat is mainly caused by bacteria such as Salmonella, E. coli, and Campylobacter. Symptoms can range from mild to serious.\nCommon symptoms:\nNausea and vomiting\nDiarrhea\nStomach pain\nFever\nChildren, the elderly, and people with weak immune systems are at greater risk of serious complications.\nSafe slaughtering practices\nFor many, Dashain tradition involves slaughtering goats or other animals at home. However, if not done hygienically, it can become a major source of infection.\nThe slaughter site should be clean and away from household waste or drainage.\nThe animal should be healthy and inspected before slaughter.\nAdequate clean water must be available for washing hands, tools, and meat. Tools should be thoroughly cleaned with soap and hot water before and after use.\nThe person handling slaughter must maintain proper hygiene. Meat can easily be contaminated by an unclean handler.\nAnyone with contagious illnesses (like colds, fever, or skin infections) should not take part.\nInternal organs must be carefully removed to avoid rupturing intestines, which can spread fecal matter and bacteria to the meat.\nAfter preparation, meat should be cooled quickly to below 4°C, using refrigerators or clean ice, to prevent bacterial growth.\nKitchen safety\nOnce meat enters the kitchen, strict hygiene is essential.\nKeep raw meat separate from vegetables and ready-to-eat foods. Use separate cutting boards, knives, and utensils.\nAlways wash hands thoroughly with soap and water before and after handling raw meat.\nCooking meat properly\nCooking kills most harmful bacteria. Meat should be cooked until the pink color disappears.\nFor large cuts, the minimum recommended internal temperature is 62.8°C, best measured with a food thermometer.\nStorage methods: Modern and traditional\nRefrigeration/Freezing\n:\nStore fresh meat at or below 4°C and consume within a few days. For longer storage, freeze in airtight packaging. Ensure the refrigerator is clean to avoid contamination.\nConfit (Preserving in Fat)\n:\nMeat, especially goat, pork, or duck, is slow-cooked and submerged in its own fat. The fat acts as a protective seal. This method does not require refrigeration.\nSalting\n:\nRaw meat is heavily salted and either hung in a dry, cool place or refrigerated at 4°C. Before use, excess salt must be washed off.\nSukuti (Dry Meat)\n:\nA traditional Nepali method. Meat is cut into strips and hung to dry, often above a hearth. Once fully dried, it can be stored for long periods without spoiling.\nPakku\n:\nA traditional Nepali dish made from goat or buffalo meat. The meat is marinated with spices and slow-cooked without water, using its own fat and juices. The result is tender, dark-colored meat that resists spoilage. It can be stored at room temperature for some time, or longer in a refrigerator.\nModeration is key\nOvereating oily and spicy meat dishes can cause digestive problems. Meals should be balanced with fresh vegetables, salads, and fruits.\nStay hydrated\nDrink plenty of clean water throughout the day to aid digestion.\n— By Bikram Limbu\n(\nLimbu, is a Food Research Officer with the Government of Nepal.\n)\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nDashain\nManaslu\ndurga\nTaleju\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nWhy it’s offensive to offer a lamb dinner to the Hindu god Ganesha?\n8 years ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nNepal’s Gen Z movement captures French media and inspires protesters\nDashain and the celebration of the sacred feminine amid social ironies\nFinance Ministry launches digital approval system\nGovernment bans foreign travel, cuts facilities in austerity push\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nBlog\nClay and culture: The making of Durga idols\n12 hours ago\nFestival\nTaleju Temple welcomes devotees on Maha Nawami\n13 hours ago\nTravel\nManaslu climbing in autumn starts on encouraging note; Nima Chhiring sets new record\n14 hours ago\nFestival\nMaha Astami festival being observed today\n1 day ago\nFood & beverage\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\n2 days ago",
