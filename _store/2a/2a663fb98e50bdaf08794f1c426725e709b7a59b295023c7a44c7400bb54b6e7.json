The market will remain closed tomorrow due to the Ghatasthapana public holiday.\nMany investors had opposed the weighted average method, saying it dragged down the market. The method had been in effect since March 21. With its removal, indices will now be calculated on the basis of the final traded price.\nPreviously, indices were determined using the weighted average of all transactions between 2:45 pm and 3:00 pm. Investors argued that this often pulled the market further down.\nErrors had also been reported in the calculation process. Brokers had long demanded the removal of the method, citing NEPSE’s automated system as outdated and substandard.\nFor example, after market closure on July 27, the weighted average calculation showed NEPSE had dropped by 2 points, whereas it had actually gained 10 points before the adjustment. Following an apology and correction by NEPSE, the index was revised to a 7-point gain.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\ngold\nFederalism\nBuddha Air\nkp oli\noath\ngen z protest\nMinister\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nTrading halted after triple negative circuit break on NEPSE\n5 days ago\nNEPSE index falls to 2,646 points, dropped by 11.97 points\n4 months ago\nNEPSE: Hotel and investment sectors surge, following budget announcement\n4 months ago\nNEPSE: Stock market declines for fourth consecutive day\n4 months ago\nNEPSE drops nearly 15 points, closing at 2,634 points\n4 months ago\nNEPSE index rises as share transactions cross Rs 10 Billion\n5 months ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n4 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n8 hours ago\nInterview\nEva Maria Belser: Even a small country can practice effective federalism\n10 hours ago\nOpinion\nHow foreign companies can register a branch office in Nepal\n11 hours ago\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n1 day ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n1 day ago",
