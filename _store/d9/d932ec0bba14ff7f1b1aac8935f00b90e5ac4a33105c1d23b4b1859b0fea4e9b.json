There had been protests claiming that insufficient time was given for applications and that some committee members had conflicts of interest regarding Oscar standards.\nCommittee Chair Bimal Paudel said that the decision made earlier was put on hold following a meeting on Saturday. He added that a fresh call for applications will be opened with a five-day deadline.\n“After much thought and discussion, the previous decision has been suspended. Now we are preparing to call for new applications and include films that were left out,” Paudel said\nOnlinekhabar\n. “The call for applications may come as early as today.”\nAccording to him, films other than Anjila and Gunyu Cholo, which were previously considered, will also be reviewed after applications are reopened. According to sources, the producers of Gunyu Cholo along with some other filmmakers have even filed complaints with the Oscar headquarters regarding the dispute.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nNepali film ‘Anjila’ recommended for Oscar Award\n5 days ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n7 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n7 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n14 hours ago\nInterview\nEva Maria Belser: Even a small country can practice effective federalism\n16 hours ago\nOpinion\nHow foreign companies can register a branch office in Nepal\n16 hours ago\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n1 day ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n2 days ago",
