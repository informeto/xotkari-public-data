  "content": "Hamas releases farewell picture of 48 hostages including Nepali Bipin Joshi\nOnlinekhabar\nSunday, September 21, 2025\n0\nComments\nKathmandu, September 21\nHamas’s armed wing has included the photo of Nepali national Bipin Joshi in a “farewell picture” of 48 Israeli hostages held in Gaza.\nAlthough the images were released under the title of a “farewell picture,” nothing has been revealed about the condition of the captives. The\nTimes of Israel\nreported that Hamas released the photo to pressure the families of hostages and the Israeli government.\nHamas has claimed that Israel’s extensive ground and air strikes have endangered the safety of the captives in Gaza.\nAccording to\nAl Jazeera\n, Hamas published the farewell picture at a time when the Israeli military was continuing its campaign to destroy and take control of the largest city in the besieged area.\nThe Qassam Brigades posted a compiled photo online on Saturday showing the faces of both living and dead hostages. They were all captioned as “Ron Arad.”\nAl Jazeera noted that Ron Arad refers to an Israeli Air Force captain who disappeared in Lebanon in 1986.\nArad’s F-4 Phantom aircraft was damaged after an early bomb explosion during an attack over southern Lebanon. He was captured by the Amal Movement and later handed over to Hezbollah. Arad is believed to have died, but there is no definitive evidence about his fate.\nAlong with the photos, Hamas wrote: “Because of Netanyahu’s refusal and Zamir’s surrender, this farewell picture is released at the time of the beginning of military operations in Gaza City.”\nThis statement reflects Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s repeated insistence on not making any deal with Hamas to end what he calls the genocidal war in Gaza. It also hints at the context where Israeli Army Chief Eyal Zamir, despite publicly expressing opposition to the government’s “Victory in Gaza City” plan, has led the expansion of ground and air offensives.\nIsraeli officials believe around 20 hostages are still alive in Gaza, while U.S. President Donald Trump has said that fewer than 20 may be alive.\nTrump and Netanyahu have reiterated that they will bring back all hostages—both living and dead—and “destroy” Hamas.\nHamas has repeatedly warned that the intensifying Israeli bombardment and expanded ground operations are putting hostages’ lives at greater risk. According to the group, some captives have already been killed by Israeli airstrikes.\nThe Palestinian armed group has also claimed that the hostages are “scattered across different neighborhoods in Gaza.”\nHamas published this list on Saturday as hundreds of thousands of Israelis took to the streets of Tel Aviv and other cities to protest against the government, demanding an immediate agreement to end the war and return all hostages.\nEarlier this month, Hamas released a video of two Israeli hostages. About a month before that, it had broadcast footage of two extremely frail hostages.\nThese images have sparked anger among the families of captives, Israeli government officials, U.S. authorities, and other Israeli allies.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nMother and sister of Bipin Joshi meet Israeli president and parliament speaker\n1 month ago\nBipin Joshi’s mother and sister travel to Israel to seek his release from Hamas\n1 month ago\nHamas to release 33 hostages in first phase, Bipin Joshi not included in the list\n8 months ago\nNepal’s Foreign Minister NP Saud leaving for Qatar to seek Bipin Joshi’s release on December 9\n2 years ago\nForeign ministry says Bipin Joshi is alive in Gaza\n2 years ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n13 hours ago\nInterview\nEva Maria Belser: Even a small country can practice effective federalism\n15 hours ago\nOpinion\nHow foreign companies can register a branch office in Nepal\n15 hours ago\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n1 day ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n2 days ago",
