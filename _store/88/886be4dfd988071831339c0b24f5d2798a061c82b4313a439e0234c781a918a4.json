Unlike in 2017 and 2022, when federal and provincial elections were held simultaneously, this time they will take place in separate phases.\nThe House of Representatives election has been scheduled for March 5, while the provincial assembly elections will only be held in 2028. Local level elections will also be conducted the same year, with local polls taking place before the provincial vote.\nThe last provincial elections were held on November 20, 2022. Completing the five-year term means the next provincial elections will likely fall around November 2028. Similarly, the last local elections were held on May 14, 2022, which sets the next round for late April 2028.\nIn the past, when all three levels of elections were conducted together, the federal government itself was dissolved as the House’s tenure ended at the same time. This time, however, that scenario will not occur.\nThe elections were rescheduled after the House was dissolved following the Gen-Z protests of September 8–9. Then Prime Minister KP Sharma Oli was forced to resign, and with no possibility of forming a new government from within parliament, an interim government led by former Chief Justice Sushila Karki was appointed.\nActing on the interim government’s recommendation, President Ram Chandra Paudel dissolved the House and set March 5 as the election date.\nElection Commission officials said that while there had been discussion of holding all three elections together, the dissolution of the House and the announcement of the new date has now paved the way for elections to be held in three separate phases.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nGovernment moves ahead with election preparations while major parties remain uncertain\n1 week ago\nElection Code of Conduct enforced from today, social media users also under scrutiny\n11 months ago\nElection for NA Committee chairs to be held on September 16\n1 year ago\nDemocracy’s promise to the poor hindered by corruption\n1 year ago\nNational Assembly election taking place today\n2 years ago\nCricket Association of Nepal to hold election on September 22 and 23\n2 years ago\nMost Read\nVarious ways you can enjoy goat meat this Dashain festival\nAryatara chosen as new Kumari\nFire rages near Kasthamandap, largely under control\nHistoric triumph as Nepal beats West Indies in T20I\n6 safe meat practices to prevent food poisoning this Dashain\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n2 weeks ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nEconomy\nCAA publishes domestic airfare rates, Kathmandu–Dhangadhi at Rs 17,579\n1 day ago\nPolitics\nElection schedule to change: Provincial and local polls to follow federal elections\n1 day ago\nFestival\nDashain Tika continues on Ekadashi Day\n1 day ago\nSociety\nMonsoon triggers flood and landslide risks in several districts, DHM issues special alert\n2 days ago\nFestival\nLiving Goddess Kumari to offer Dashain Tika to public today\n2 days ago",
