They said the backup data can be recovered and services can resume.\nDuring the peak of the Gen-Z movement on September 8 and 9, the office of the Department of Transport Management, located east of the Parliament building, was also set on fire.\nThe blaze destroyed all embossed number data, the smart license printing machine, and around 600,000 of the 1.2 million printed smart licenses. However, the remaining 600,000 licenses, which had already been printed and were ready for distribution, were found to be intact.\nOn Friday morning, during a cleanup program at the department’s premises, employees briefed Minister for Physical Infrastructure and Transport, Kulman Ghising, that smart license data could be recovered.\nIn response, Minister Ghising said arrangements would be made with the National Identity and Civil Registration Department to print essential licenses.\n“There is a possibility of printing licenses from the machine used for national ID cards,” Minister Ghising said. “If travelers going abroad urgently need licenses, coordination will be made to print them from the National Identity and Registration Department’s machine.”\nAccording to the Department of Transport Management, 2.5 million smart licenses are yet to be printed, and preparations are underway to immediately call for tenders to procure printing materials.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\noath\nMinister\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nCommercial driver’s license to be mandatory for public transport drivers\n7 months ago\nMost Read\nUAE tightens visit visa rules for Nepalis\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n4 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n12 hours ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n14 hours ago\nCulture\nGhatasthapana performed at Hanumandhoka, marking the start of Dashain festival (Photos)\n17 hours ago\nPolitics\nInjured Gen Z protesters stage sit-in at Singha Durbar gate (Photos)\n2 days ago\nFestival\nWhat are the chances of rain during Dashain this year?\n2 days ago",
