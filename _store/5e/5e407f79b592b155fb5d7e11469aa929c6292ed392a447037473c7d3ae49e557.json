The UAE has suspended visit visas and imposed stricter rules on work visas, while Malaysia, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and other nations have also tightened their work visa policies.\nForeign Ministry spokesperson Lok Bahadur Paudel Kshetri said the government is seeking clarifications from its embassies. “We are trying to understand from our embassies why some nations have imposed such restrictions,” he said.\nThe visa restrictions are linked to the “Gen Z” protests of September 8–9, during which thousands of prisoners escaped from prisons and weapons were looted from security personnel. Citing concerns that escaped convicts could enter their countries and engage in criminal activities, Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) nations have enforced stricter visa requirements.\nMore than 14,000 inmates fled from prisons across Nepal during the unrest, with around 7,000 still at large. Following this, the UAE was the first to stop issuing visit visas and tighten work visas from September 15, which was later followed by other GCC member states—Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Kuwait, and Oman.\nManpower agencies confirmed that Malaysia, Qatar, and Saudi Arabia have also introduced tougher visa procedures. The Foreign Ministry has assured that diplomatic efforts are underway to normalise the situation.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nNepal\nLandslide\nDashain\nelection\nprotest\nMuglin\nGen-Z\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nNepal abolishes rubella: WHO\n1 month ago\nNew bird species recorded in Nepal\n2 months ago\nNepal secures another dominant 7-0 victory over Sri Lanka in SAFF U-20 Women’s Championship\n2 months ago\nStorage projects: Missing pieces of Nepal’s hydro puzzle\n2 months ago\nNepal facing Sri Lanka today in AFC Women’s Asian Cup Qualifiers\n3 months ago\nNepal Women’s Team dominates Laos in 9-goal\n3 months ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nHamas releases farewell picture of 48 hostages including Nepali Bipin Joshi\nNew Gen-Z party could emerge in support of Balen\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n1 week ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nOpinion\nPost Gen Z Protests: Is the country dancing on the pinhead?
