Other documents and files at the District Office were also burned.\n“We haven’t suffered much other damage, but the corruption case file of the Tax Settlement Commission has been deliberately taken,” a source from the Special Government Attorney’s Office said. “It is quite surprising that no other files were touched, only that particular one was removed.”\nThe case involves former Director General of the Inland Revenue Department and then Member Secretary of the Tax Settlement Commission, Chudamani Sharma, among others.\nFrom the District Government Attorney’s Office, the file of the Swarnalaxmi Cooperative fraud case in Kalimati, Kathmandu, has gone missing. Former Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane, along with several others, was charged in this case.\nIn addition, the file related to the violent incident that took place in Tinkune on March 28 has also disappeared. The case involved charges against Durga Prasai, Dhawal Shumsher Jabara, Rabindra Mishra, among others.\n“In Kathmandu, files of many other cases have also been burned,” a source from the Office of the Attorney General said. “Among them are cases related to cooperative fraud and offenses against the state.”\nA few years ago, the Office of the Attorney General had divided the same building into two offices: the District Government Attorney’s Office on the right side and the Special Government Attorney’s Office on the left. The Special Government Attorney’s Office handles corruption and related cases.\nDuring the\nGen Z movement\n, several courts including the Supreme Court were set on fire. From the government attorney offices official documents and computer hard drives were stolen.\n“The cabinets containing files were not damaged, nor were other nearby files touched. Only files related to certain individuals were deliberately removed,” said a source from the Special Government Attorney’s Office.\nOfficials of the Tax Settlement Commission who had been convicted by the Special Court had appealed to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court, ruling that their cases were decided without following due process, had sent the files back to the Special Court for rehearing.\nIn the Swarnalaxmi Cooperative fraud case, former Home Minister Rabi Lamichhane had been released on bail. In the Supreme Cooperative case, he was detained only after an order from the Butwal bench of the High Court. In the Tinkune violent incident case, all politically affiliated accused had been released on bail.\nGovernment officials suspect that the files may have been deliberately disappeared by taking advantage of the protests.\nSources say Prime Minister Sushila Karki and cabinet ministers believe those who infiltrated the protests to break out of jail, vandalize courts and government offices, and steal official documents must be immediately punished.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nJanardan Baral\nBaral is an associate editor and the head of the business bureau.\nMore From the Author\nKrishna Gyawali\nGyawali is a senior journalist at Onlinekhabar.\nMore From the Author\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nBuddha Air to resume regular flights to Kolkata, 3 times a week\n18 hours ago\nTwenty-four climbers take permits to climb Mt Dhaulagiri\n20 hours ago\nGold price reaches record high\n20 hours ago\nKP Oli makes first public appearance since resignation\n21 hours ago\nEva Maria Belser: Even a small country can practice effective federalism\n22 hours ago\nHow foreign companies can register a branch office in Nepal\n22 hours ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nAttempted attack on Hami Nepal coordinator Sudan Gurung\nNew Gen-Z party could emerge in support of Balen\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n7 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n7 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n20 hours ago\nInterview\nEva Maria Belser: Even a small country can practice effective federalism\n22 hours ago\nOpinion\nHow foreign companies can register a branch office in Nepal\n22 hours ago\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n2 days ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n2 days ago",
