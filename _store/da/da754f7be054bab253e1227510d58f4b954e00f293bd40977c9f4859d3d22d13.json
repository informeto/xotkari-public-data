The festival officially begins tomorrow, September 22, with Ghatasthapana.\nAs people prepare to celebrate Dashain, curiosity about the weather during the festival is natural. Will this year’s Dashain be rainy?\nAccording to meteorologist Dr Binod Pokharel, there is a high chance of a rainy Dashain this year. He explained that the weather will not be very active for the first week starting from Ghatasthapana, though there is still the possibility of showers in some places during the evenings. “In the second week, around the middle of the festival, weather activity is expected to increase, which makes the likelihood of a rainy Dashain across Nepal very high,” Dr Pokharel said.\nSystem developing in the Bay of Bengal\nDisaster management expert and weather researcher Dr Dharma Raj Upreti also said that the monsoon is expected to persist in Nepal through Dashain.\nAccording to him, a weather system is likely to develop in the Bay of Bengal starting Ashoj 9. Its major impact will be felt in Bangladesh, Myanmar, and the Indian states of Sikkim, Assam, and Meghalaya. It may partially affect Nepal’s eastern border areas, potentially delaying the monsoon’s withdrawal from Nepal, Dr Upreti noted.\nWeather forecasts are generally based on models such as ICON, GFS, and ECMWF (European model). However, these models do not show identical outcomes.\nThe European model indicates little chance of rainfall in eastern Nepal but predicts heavy rainfall in India’s Uttarakhand and Himachal Pradesh, which could have some impact on Nepal’s Sudurpaschim Province.\nBecause different models present varying possibilities, Dr Upreti advised the public to rely on official updates only from the Department of Hydrology and Meteorology. “Some models show rainfall starting next Sunday in areas from Koshi to Gandaki Province, while others even predict showers during the festival days themselves. Therefore, it is best to follow official updates from the department,” he said.\nWhat do meteorologists at the Department say?\nThe Department of Hydrology and Meteorology generally does not provide official forecasts beyond three days.\nAccording to meteorologist Govinda Jha of the department’s Weather Forecasting Division, a special Dashain bulletin will be issued to provide official information on festival weather. He urged people to wait a few days and not rely on unofficial sources.\nAnother meteorologist from the department said the system developing in the Bay of Bengal is unlikely to have a direct impact on Nepal. “It will move through central India, so Nepal will not be directly affected,” he said.\nAs for the immediate forecast, there is a chance of moderate rainfall in some hilly areas of Koshi and Bagmati Provinces today. Tomorrow and the day after, most parts of the country are expected to see clear weather.\nReact to this post\nHot Topics\nCOVID-19 Nepal\nKP Sharma Oli\nNepal covid-19\nCPN-UML\nNepali Congress\nNepal\nNepalelection\nConversation\nNew\nOld\nPopular\nAdd Comment\nLogin to comment\nRemenber me\nForgot password?\nLogin\nNot have account yet?\nSignup Now\nOr use Social Media?\nGoogle\nFacebook\nTwitter\nForgot Password?\nSend Password Reset Link\nBack\nRelated News\nGhatasthapana performed at Hanumandhoka, marking the start of Dashain festival (Photos)\n2 days ago\nDashain Tika auspicious time at 11:53 am on October 2\n6 days ago\nNo advance ticket bookings for Dashain\n6 days ago\nDiscussion on opening Dashain advance ticket booking today\n1 week ago\n7 evergreen songs for your Deusi-Bhailo programme this Tihar\n11 months ago\nKojagrat Poornima being observed today\n11 months ago\nMost Read\nGold price hikes by Rs 1,100 per tola\nNepalis face residency permit cancellation at Lisbon Airport\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\nSubscribe to our newsletter\nSubscribe to Onlinekhabar English to get notified of exclusive news stories.\nEditor's Pick\nEditor's Pick\n4 government buildings, including Supreme Court, declared unfit for use\n5 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nCharred body found at Koteshwor Bhatbhateni, Gen-Z protest death toll rises to 74\n6 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nNo consensus on Hami Nepal’s claim of leading the Gen-Z movement\n7 days ago\nEditor's Pick\nDecades-old irrigation projects stall as Madhesh faces drought, food crisis looms\n2 months ago\nEditor's Pick\nNepal’s farming crisis: When plans stay on paper and fields suffer\n2 months ago\nAlso Read\nPolitics\nFiles from Tax Settlement, Swarnalaxmi Cooperative, and Tinkune Violence cases go missing\n13 hours ago\nInterview\nEva Maria Belser: Even a small country can practice effective federalism\n15 hours ago\nOpinion\nHow foreign companies can register a branch office in Nepal\n16 hours ago\nPolitics\nFour new ministers take the oath\n1 day ago\nCrime\nEscaped inmates gradually returning to Gandaki prisons with police still searching\n2 days ago",
